<h1>Cyn (AKA CooldudePUGS online)</h1>
<p>I'm a nerd that does nerd things</p>
<p>Notably, I'm a fairly active contributor to the <a href="https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarWiki/commits?author=CooldudePUGS">Northstar Wiki</a>, a decently active helper in the <a href="https://northstar.tf/discord">Northstar Discord server</a>, and musician (viola and guitar)</p>
<p>I've also created an <a href="https://github.com/CooldudePUGS/Spectre">open source Discord bot</a> to automatically redirect users asking for help in the Northstar discord to the help channels</p>
<p>Maybe I'll make this website not garbage at some point but I was bored and wanted to learn HTML basics lol</p>
